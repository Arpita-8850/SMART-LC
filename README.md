## Need:
- 80% Indian colleges provide only hard copy of documents & certificates, but completing the procedure is very time-consuming as it requires a lot of paperwork which brings extreme pressure on staff and students. 
- Apart from that, there is also wastage of papers as paperwork require bundles of document copies. 
- So we came up an idea of getting these documents and certificates through a machine. 
- This project can complete 2-3 days of task in a minute and there won't be any need of paperwork as all the verification process will be done by the machine itself.
