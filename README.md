# SMART LC
- **SMART LC** - Smart Leaving Certificate.
- A vending machine that automatically verifies all the required data from the server of the student and prints certificates & documents needed by the students.
- Through this project, students can get hard copy of any document within a minute.
- For demo purpose we have added Leaving Certificate, Train Concession and bonafide.

## Need:
- 80% Indian colleges provide only hard copy of documents & certificates, but completing the procedure is very time-consuming as it requires a lot of paperwork which brings extreme pressure on staff and students. 
- Apart from that, there is also wastage of papers as paperwork require bundles of document copies. 
- So we came up an idea of getting these documents and certificates through a machine. 
- This project can complete 2-3 days of task in a minute and there won't be any need of paperwork as all the verification process will be done by the machine itself.
